            § 3280.309 Health Notice on formaldehyde emissions.
  </b>
        </p>
        <p> (a) Each manufactured home shall have a Health Notice on formaldehyde emissions prominently displayed in a temporary
        manner in the kitchen (i.e., countertop or exposed cabinet face). The Notice shall read as follows:
</p>
        <p>Important Health Notice</p>
        <p>Some of the building materials used in this home emit formaldehyde. Eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache,
        nausea, and a variety of asthma-like symptoms, including shortness of breath, have been reported as a result of
        formaldehyde exposure. Elderly persons and young children, as well as anyone with a history of asthma, allergies, or
        lung problems, may be at greater risk. Research is continuing on the possible long-term effects of exposure to
  formaldehyde.</p>
        <p>Reduced ventilation resulting from energy efficiency standards may allow formaldehyde and other contaminants to
        accumulate in the indoor air. Additional ventilation to dilute the indoor air may be obtained from a passive or
        mechanical ventilation system offered by the manufacturer. Consult your dealer for information about the ventilation
  options offered with this home.</p>
        <p>High indoor temperatures and humidity raise formaldehyde levels. When a home is to be located in areas subject to
        extreme summer temperatures, an air-conditioning system can be used to control indoor temperature levels. Check the
        comfort cooling certificate to determine if this home has been equipped or designed for the installation of an
        air-conditioning system.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding the health effects of formaldehyde, consult your doctor or local health
  department.</p>
        <p>(b) The Notice shall be legible and typed using letters at least1/4inch in size. The title shall be typed using
  letters at least3/4inch in size.</p>
        <p>(c) The Notice shall not be removed by any party until the entire sales transaction has been completed (refer to part
  3282—Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations for provisions regarding a sales transaction).</p>
        <p>(d) A copy of the Notice shall be included in the Consumer Manual (refer to part 3283—Manufactured Home Consumer
  Manual Requirements).</p>
