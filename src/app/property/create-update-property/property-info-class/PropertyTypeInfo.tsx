          <h4>Regular Excess Screening (No Special Requirements)</h4>
          <p>Often called “excess”, this is the most common property type (FMR §102-36.35). 
            Excess property is offered for no cost transfer to eligible recipients. 
            If sold, the excess sales proceeds are returned to the Treasury.</p>
          
          <h4>Surplus Sale Proceeds Retention</h4>
          <p>A type of “excess” property that is offered for no cost transfer to eligible recipients. 
            If not transferred and is offered to the public for sale, the agency is reimbursed funds equal to its costs 
            of care and handling directly related to the sale of personal property (FMR §102-38.295 (b)). 
            Reimbursed funds not directly related to the sale of property must be remitted to the Treasury. 
            Considering the financial recordkeeping required, this property type is not used often. 
            Direct or reasonably related indirect expenses may include: 
               1)Warehousing/Storage - e.g., before or while GSA is selling the property, 
               2) Sales Preparation, 
               3) Environmental Services, 
               4) Demilitarization Services, 
               5) Advertising, 
               6) Appraisal, 
               7) Transportation of Property, 
               8) Labor or Contract Costs related to the sale of property, 
               9) Agency established overhead rate for these functions.

          <h4>Exchange Sale (Replacement Authority)</h4>
          <p>
            Title 40 of the United States Code, Section 503 is the authority for exchange/sale.
          </p>
          <p>
             Exchange/sale means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property 
             and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole 
             or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property.
          </p>
          <p>
            The regulation for the "Replacement of Personal Property Pursuant 
            to the Exchange/Sale Authority" is the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) 102.39.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Replacement" means the process of acquiring property to be used in place of property 
             that is still needed but: 
               (1) No longer adequately performs the tasks for which it is used; or 
               (2) Does not meet the agency's need as well as the property to be acquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain classifications of property do not qualify for the exchange/sale authority. 
            These property classifications make up the prohibited list and are itemized in FMR 102-39.45. 
            Property within these classifications cannot be exchanged under 
            the exchange/sale authority or sold without a waiver from GSA.
          </p>
          <p>
            For information on what conditions for exchange/sale of personal property, see FMR 102-39.50.
          </p>
          <p>
            For information on the accounting procedures for proceeds acquired from exchange/sale of personal property, see FMR 102-39.70.
          </p>

          <h4>Property was purchased with Working Capital (WCF) or Revolving Fund</h4>
          <p>
            FMR 102-36.285(a)(3) states "It is current executive branch policy that
             working capital fund property shall be transferred without reimbursement." 
             However, WCF and revolving fund excess personal property is also generally 
             reimbursable when sold. As such, an Agency Location Code and 
             appropriation number may be entered (optional) if the reporting agency 
             wants surplus sales proceeds when reporting this type of property.
          </p>

          <h4>Special Legislative Authority</h4>
          <p>
            The property was acquired with appropriated funds, but reimbursement 
            is required or authorized by law. Unless the agency has special legislative 
            authority making working capital funds or revolving funds reimbursable; 
            FMR 102-36.285(a) (3) states "It is current executive branch policy that 
            working capital fund property shall be transferred without reimbursement".
          </p>
          <h4>Purchased with non-appropriated funds (Non-appropriated Fund Activity)</h4>
          <p>
            This is any activity or entity that is not funded by money appropriated 
            from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, such as, post exchanges, 
            ship stores, military officers' clubs, veterans' canteens, and similar activities. 
            Such property is not Federal property.
          </p>
          <h4>Reported by a Wholly Owned or Mixed Ownership Government Corporation</h4>
          <p>
            Congress usually defines a government corporation as wholly-owned (where 
            the government holds all the equity), mixed-ownership (where the government 
            holds some of the equity), or private (where the government holds none of 
            the equity but the corporation is backed to some degree by the Treasury). 
            For a listing of activities, see 31 U.S.C. Chapter 91, Section 9101 (definitions), 
            of the Government Corporation Control Act. Some well known Government corporations 
            are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); National Railroad Passenger 
            Corporation (Amtrak); Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
