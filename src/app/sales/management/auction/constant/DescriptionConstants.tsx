      ***** The certification provided will be subject to review by the Sales Contracting Officer (SCO) prior to finalization of award.
      Therefore, bids are binding and GSA Auctions will make award within 2 business days, if not sooner, after receipt of the bidder's certification.
      This provision supersedes the Online Sale Terms and Conditions in which you accepted when you first registered. By submission of your bid on this
      auction, you hereby agree to the terms and conditions of this sale including this amended provision. <br/>
      This auction is subject to the following provisions: This item is non-functional Federal Electronics Assets (FEA) and in an effort to improve the
      management of electronics in the United States, the Federal Government issued the National Strategy in July 2011. The National Strategy, in a
      section entitled, "Ensure that the Federal Government Leads by Example," mandates that non-functional FEA be directed to third-party certified
      refurbishers or recyclers. In support of the National Strategy, GSA requires that Federal agencies only dispose of non-functional electronic equipment
      using contracts with sales or sales to refurbishers or recyclers certified under an accredited, third-party electronics recycler certification
      program, or manufacturer take-back programs that utilize refurbishers or recyclers certified under such a certification program. <br/>
      The Federal Government has determined that improper handling and disposal of non-functional electronics may have potentially harmful
      effects on human health and the environment. Certified recyclers and refurbishers are able to properly handle, manage, and, if necessary,
      dispose of non-functional FEA. They are able to offer the Government protection against improper handling and disposal, whereas non-certified
      parties are not. Both of these certification programs offer concrete assurances that non-functional FEA is handled properly to protect the public's
      health and safety, while non-certified recyclers are not held to such standards. GSA is unwilling to take the risk that a non-certified recycler may
      act in a manner that may endanger public safety and health either domestically by dumping products in landfills or internationally by exporting
      electronic waste to developing nations for uncontrolled demanufacturing/recycling.<br/>

      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;At the auction close time if no bids(proxy or flat) are placed

      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> "N/A" or a blank indicates that the value is
      not available for this auction.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;How To Bid</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Placing a Bid</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;Auctions for real property accept flat or automatic bids.
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Flat bid:</strong> A flat bid is for an amount at least the
      current bid plus the posted minimum Bid Increment.If the bid is greater
      than &nbsp;another bidders automatic bid, the system will consider this
      flat bid as the current(high) bid.If the bid is less than or equal to
      &nbsp;another bidders automatic bid, the system will record the bid but it
      will not be considered the current(high) bid.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Automatic bid:</strong> An automatic bid is an amount that
      you set above the posted minimum bid.Realestatesales.gov will use as
      &nbsp;much of your bid as needed to make you the current winner of the
      auction or to meet the auction reserve price.The system
      &nbsp;will automatically apply the minimum Bid Increment up to the total
      amount bid to make you the current winner of the
      &nbsp;auction or to meet the auctions reserve price.Your automatic bid
      amount is not shown to other bidders until it is reached
      &nbsp;through competitive bidding.You may change your bid amount but not
      less than the next bid increment amount.'
      <br />
      &nbsp;GSA Auctions only accepts bids in whole dollar amounts.Bids in
      partial dollar amounts, $150.25 for example, will not be
      &nbsp;accepted by the GSA Auctions system.'
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Reserve Price</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;The reserve price is the minimum price that GSA Auctions is willing
      to accept for an item.If your maximum bid equals or
      &nbsp;exceeds the reserve price, your bid will be placed at the reserve
      price.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Tie Bids</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;If a bidder places a bid with the same automatic bid amount as
      another bidder, the previous(first) bidder will have the high
      &nbsp;bid since their bid was placed first.Both bids are recorded with the
      same amount, displaying the first bidder with the same
      amount as high bidder, until another bidder bids higher.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Competing Automatic Bids</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;When two automatic bids compete, the greater of the two automatic
      bids always wins.If the greater automatic bid exceeds
      &nbsp;the lesser automatic bid by the bid increment, then a bid equal to
      the lesser automatic bid plus the bid increment will be
      &nbsp;placed.If the greater automatic bid does not exceed the lesser
      automatic bid by the bid increment, then the greater
      &nbsp;automatic bids total bid amount will be placed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Changing Your Automatic Bid</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;You can increase your automatic bid if you are currently the winner
      in an auction.To increase your automatic bid, enter an
      &nbsp;amount greater than your current automatic bid.Increasing your bid
      will not increase your current high bid.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;You can decrease your automatic bid if you are currently the winner
      in an auction.To decrease your automatic bid, enter an
      &nbsp;amount less than your current automatic bid.You cannot decrease your
      bid below the minimum bid price.Changing your
      &nbsp;automatic bid may affect the indicated time remaining.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Winning the auction</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;The highest bid at the close of the auction will be considered for
      award of the sale.The Government reserves the right to
      &nbsp;reject any and all bids for any reason.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Changes to the Bid Increment</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;Real property auctions will typically maintain the bid increment
      throughout the sale.However, in some sales the bid increment may be decreased or increased based on bidder
      activity.Announcements will be made on - line prior to any such change.Bidders should check the sale frequently for announced changes.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>&nbsp;Changes to the Bidding Interval</strong>
      <br />
      &nbsp;Real property auctions close by announcing the sale end date and
      time and a bidding interval(usually 24 - hours) whereby the highest bid received must survive the full bid interval period
      before the auction closes.However, the bid interval may be decreased or increased or eliminated at any time based on
      bidder activity.Announcements will be made on - line prior to any such change.Bidders should check the sale frequently
      for announced changes.
